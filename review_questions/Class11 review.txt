-- Traversals --
What are the recursive relations we used to define the three canonical traversals?
What order would the three canonical traversals and the two traversals from the search algorithms visit the nodes of the tree on the board?
For a tree with 5 nodes, draw the function stack when performing a postorder traversal.
Come up with a new recursively defined traversal.
Which two traversals we have covered are identical except one is the reverse of the other?
