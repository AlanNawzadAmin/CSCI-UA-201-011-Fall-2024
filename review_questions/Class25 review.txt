Write out Breadth first search in a graph using a queue.
Say whenever we see a new vertex in DFS or BFS we add the edge that connected it to the previous vertex to a list. What can we say about the graph we get at the end? What vertices will it contain? Will it have any loops?
Write out an algorithm to find out if a node v is part of a directed cycle. What about checking if a descendent of a node v is part of a directed cycle?
Can we swap out Stack or Queue for a priority queue?
